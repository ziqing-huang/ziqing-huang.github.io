        - Advised by Prof. <a href="https://kimiyoung.github.io/">Zhilin Yang</a>.
        - Research topic： web page creation.
        - We combine probabilistic and rule-based methods to create web pages from text with different levels of inputs, such as the content on the page and the description of the style.

        - Research topic： information retrieval.
        - We widely explored and compared the performance of different retrieval systems on different datasets.
        - We proposed corpus poisoning attacks on retrieval. We show that by inserting a limited number of passages into the corpus, we can mislead the retrievers to retrieve them.

        - Research topic： information retrieval.
        - We built a strong baseline on MS MARCO passage retrieval task based on ANCE and OpenMatch.
        # - We used a memory bank to include more negative samples in a single batch to improve retrieval performance with affordable batch size.
