I am able to speak a limited amount of Japanese in addition to Chinese and English.

I've played a variety of sports, such as football, badminton, table tennis, and tennis. Currently I enjoy tennis most of the time. I'm the leader of IIIS tennis club right now.

My roommates [Mengdi Wu](https://wmdi.github.io/) (computer systems and compilers), [Yaxin Tu](https://tu-yaxin.github.io/) (crypto), and [Zihan Hu](https://zihanhu.cn/) (crypto, quantum) are also outstanding researchers in their areas.
