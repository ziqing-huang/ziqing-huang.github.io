I am able to speak a limited amount of Japanese in addition to Chinese and English.

I've played a variety of sports, such as football, badminton, table tennis, and tennis. I was the leader of IIIS tennis club in Tsinghua University.

My roommates [Mengdi Wu](https://wmdi.github.io/) (computer systems and compilers, CMU), [Yaxin Tu](https://tu-yaxin.github.io/) (crypto, Princeton), and [Zihan Hu](https://zihanhu.cn/) (TCS) in Tsinghua are also outstanding researchers in their areas. Thanks Zihan for assistance in building this website and for capturing the photo displayed on the homepage.
